    # Owns the full arc of *one* connection: handshake → ready → closed.
    #
    # Scope boundary: ConnectionLifecycle tracks a single peer link
    # (one ZMTP connection or one inproc Pipe). SocketLifecycle
    # owns the socket-wide state above it — first-peer/last-peer
    # signaling, reconnect enable flag, the parent task tree, and the
    # open → closing → closed transitions that gate close-time drain.
    # A socket has exactly one SocketLifecycle and zero-or-more
    # ConnectionLifecycles beneath it.
    #
    # Centralizes the ordering of side effects (monitor events, routing
    # registration, promise resolution, reconnect scheduling) so the
    # sequence lives in one place instead of being scattered across
    # Engine, ConnectionSetup, and close paths.
    #
    # State machine:
    #
    #   new ──┬── :handshaking ── :ready ── :closed
    #         └── :ready ── :closed            (inproc fast path)
    #
    # #lost! and #close! are idempotent — the state guard ensures side
    # effects run exactly once even if multiple pumps race to report a
    # lost connection.
