module OMQ
  class Engine
    # Owns the socket-level state: `:new → :open → :closing → :closed`,
    # the first-peer / last-peer signaling promises, the reconnect flag,
    # and the captured parent task for the socket's task tree.
    #
    # Scope boundary: SocketLifecycle is per-socket and outlives every
    # individual peer link. ConnectionLifecycle is per-connection and
    # handles one handshake → ready → closed arc beneath it. Roughly:
    # SocketLifecycle answers "is this socket open and do we have any
    # peers?", ConnectionLifecycle answers "is this specific peer link
    # ready / lost?".
    #
    # Engine delegates state queries here and uses it to coordinate the
    # ordering of close-time side effects. This consolidates six ivars
    # (`@state`, `@peer_connected`, `@all_peers_gone`, `@reconnect_enabled`,
    # `@parent_task`, `@on_io_thread`) into one cohesive object with
    # explicit transitions.
